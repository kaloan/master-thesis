  abstract  = {Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. Although countries around the world have taken measures to decrease the incidence of malaria, many regions remain endemic. Indeed, progress towards elimination has stalled in multiple countries. While control efforts are largely focused at the national level, the movement of individuals between countries may complicate the efficacy of elimination efforts. Here, we consider the case of neighboring countries Botswana and Zimbabwe, connected by human mobility. Both have improved malaria rates in recent years with differing success. We use a two-patch Ross-MacDonald Model with Lagrangian human mobility to examine the coupled disease dynamics between these two countries. In particular, we are interested in the impact that interventions for controlling malaria applied in one country can have on the incidence of malaria in the other country. We find that dynamics and interventions in Zimbabwe can dramatically influence pathways to elimination in Botswana, largely driven by Zimbabwe{\textquoteright}s population size and larger basic reproduction number.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was initiated at a workshop that was partially supported by NSF-HRD 1500481 {\textendash} AWM ADVANCE grant; and by NSF award for SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences; number: 1757085, and UCLA IPAM.

For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R0 for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R0<1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R0>1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches.},

However, during the transitory phase, the number of infected individuals can peak at high values. Can we limit the number of infected humans at the peak? This is the question we address. More precisely, we consider a controlled version of the Ross-Macdonald epidemiological dynamical model: proportions of infected individuals and proportions of infected mosquitoes (vector) are state variables, and vector mortality is the control variable. We say that a state is viable if there exists at least one admissible control trajectory – time-dependent mosquito mortality rates bounded by control capacity – such that, starting from this state, the resulting proportion of infected individuals remains below a given infection cap for all times. The so-called viability kernel is the set of viable states. We obtain three different expressions of the viability kernel, depending on the couple control capacity-infection cap. In the comfortable case, the infection cap is high, the viability kernel is maximal and all admissible control trajectories are viable. In the desperate case, both control capacity and infection cap are too low and the viability kernel is the zero equilibrium without infection. In the remaining viable case, the viability kernel is neither zero nor maximal and not all admissible control trajectories are viable. We provide a numerical application in the case of the dengue outbreak in 2013 in Cali, Colombia.},

An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as “demographic sinks” if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become “demographic sources” of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy—albeit a conservative and possibly expensive one—in case either the human host, or the vector does not move. However, we also show that when both humans and vectors move, this strategy may fail, depending on the specific movement patterns exhibited by hosts and vectors.},

              international travel, the globalisation of trade, and climate
              change are likely to play a progressively more important role in
              the introduction, establishment and spread of arthropod-borne
              pathogens worldwide. A review of the literature reveals that many
              climatic variables, functioning singly or in combination, exert
              varying effects on the distribution and range of Culicoides
              vector midges and mosquitoes. For example, higher temperatures
              may be associated with increased insect abundance--thereby
              amplifying the risk of disease transmission--but there are no
              indications yet of dramatic shifts occurring in the geographic
              range of Culicoides midges. However, the same cannot be said for
              mosquitoes: over the last few decades, multiple Asian species
              have established themselves in Europe, spread and are unlikely to
              ever be eradicated. Research on how insects respond to changes in
              climate is still in its infancy. The authors argue that we need
              to grasp how other annectant changes, such as extremes in
              precipitation (drought and flooding), may affect the dispersal
              capability of mosquitoes. Models are useful for assessing the
              interplay between mosquito vectors expanding their range and the
              native flora and fauna; however, ecological studies employing
              classical mark-release-recapture techniques remain essential for
              addressing fundamental questions about the survival and dispersal
              of mosquito species, with the resulting parameters fed directly
              into new-generation disease transmission models. Studies on the
              eventual impact of mosquitoes on animal and human health should
              be tackled through large-scale integrated research programmes.
              Such an approach calls for more collaborative efforts, along the
              lines of the One Health Initiative.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models developed for studying malaria dynamics often focus on a single, homogeneous population. However, human movement connects environments with potentially different malaria transmission characteristics. To address the role of human movement and spatial heterogeneity in malaria transmission and malaria control, we consider a simple malaria metapopulation model incorporating two regions, or patches, connected by human movement, with different degrees of malaria transmission in each patch. Using our two-patch model, we calculate and analyze the basic reproduction number, R0, an epidemiologically important threshold quantity that indicates whether malaria will persist or go extinct in a population. Although R0 depends on the rates of human movement, we show that R0 is always bounded between the two quantities R01 and R02—the reproduction numbers for the two patches if isolated. If without migration, the disease is endemic in one patch but not in the other, then the addition of human migration can cause the disease to persist in both patches. This result indicates that regions with low malaria transmission should have an interest in helping to control or eliminate malaria in regions with higher malaria endemicity if human movement connects them. Performing a sensitivity analysis of R0 and the endemic equilibrium to various parameters in the two-patch model allowed us to determine, under different parameterizations of the model, which patch will be the better target for control measures, and within that patch, what type of control measure should be implemented. In the analysis of R0, we found that if the extrinsic incubation period is shorter than the average mosquito lifespan, the control measures should be targeted towards reducing the mosquito biting rate. On the other hand, if the extrinsic incubation period is longer than the average mosquito lifespan, control measures targeting the mosquito death rate will be more effective. Intuitively, one might think that resources for malaria control should be allocated to the region with higher malaria transmission. However, our sensitivity analyses indicated that this is not always the case. In fact, if migration into the lower transmission patch is much faster than migration into the higher transmission patch, the lower transmission patch is potentially the better target for malaria control efforts. While human movement between regions poses challenges to malaria control and elimination, if estimates of relevant parameters in the model are known, including migration rates, our results can help inform which region to target and what type of control measure to implement for the greatest success.},

The modeling of the problem leads to a mathematical formulation of stability and reachability properties of some controlled systems under uncertainties. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to address these problems and to design a numerical method that we analyze on several numerical simulations.},

Optim. Theory Appl., Vol. 70, No 1, pp 1-23, 1991). We propose a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) approach in order to compute the value function associated to the problem, as well as trajectory reconstruction procedures based on the value function, or on a related exit time function. Some numerical illustrations are included to show the relevance of our approach.},
