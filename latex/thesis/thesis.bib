	Abstract = {We study a simple model for a vector-borne disease with control intervention based on clothes and household items treated with mosquito repellents, which has constraints on the extent (population coverage) and on the time duration reflecting technological and physical properties. We compute first, the viability kernel of initial data of the model for which exists an optimal control that maintains the infected host population below a given cap for all future times. Second, we use the viability kernel to compute the set of initial data of the model for which exists an optimal control that brings this population below the cap in a time period not exceeding the intervention's duration. We discuss applications of this framework in predicting and evaluating the performance of control interventions under the given type of constraints.},

  abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R0, is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R0<1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0>1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

  abstract  = {
               Present paper discusses about mosquito repellents on textile and paints as one of attempt for protecting people
               against invasive mosquitoes which transmit arboviruses such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus, West Nile
               fever, Malaria, etc. For this purpose, the cotton fabric has been treated with selected repellents (Immortelle oil,
               Waterglass and Vibroactivated zeolites) for textiles and paints. For paints, Immortelle oil repellent was applied
               by coating special paper with paint layers between 80-160μm, and dry on the air. This paper will discuss the
               repellents efficacy, the changes of some textile structure parameters with fabric density, the amount of adsorbed
               repellents, by using gravimetric method, air permeability tester, pore dimensions Bubble Point measurements
               device and SEM image analyser.
